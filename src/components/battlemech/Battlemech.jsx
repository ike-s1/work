            These battle machines were created thousand years ago using Void Gods technologies. 
        <br/>It's impossible to recreate such machinery that’s why they are enormously expensive and their number is limited. 
        <br/>Battlemech can be destroyed only by other battlemech. 
        <br/>You will manage light, medium, heavy and extra rare behemoths – superheavy battlemechs.
